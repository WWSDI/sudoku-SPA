# Sudoku Requirements

## Core features

- fill a cell:

  - click a cell (to activate)
  - bg highlights sudoku region (sudoku means the combination of row, col and blc)
    - if ac is filled, highlights all other num on the board
  - fill a num
    - [**Persistent**] bg highlights (**errors**) conflicting nums in the sudoku region
    - user filled cell () is colored differently than autofilled cells (**black**)

- complete a board:
  - all cells filled & no errors
    - change completedGame state to be true

### Animation ‚õîÔ∏è

May need to use **react-transition-group**

- fill a row | col | blc
  - triggers a one time bc highlight animation
    - Implementation:
      - use state?

### states

**board**

```typescript
[{
  i: 44, // cell index (range from 0 - 80)
  v: 5, //cell value
  type: 'auto' // 'auto' | 'user'
  error: false // boolean. true if cell value does NOT equal the solution value
}]
```

**hightlight**

```typescript
[
  {
    i: 55, // index
    backgroundColor: "skyblue", // 'red'|'skyblue'|null
    color: "red", //'red'|null
  },
];
```

## Architecture

- frontend
  - react
  - localstorage
- backend: fetching solution and generating puzzles
  - mongoose
  - mongodb
    - store 10,000 solutions
  - local: docker + mongodb
  - remote: Atlas + mongodb
- stripe (eventually)

## Todos

- [ ] add new game feature
  - [ ] setup API server
    - [ ] GET /gameboards
      - get a single one gameboard with difficulty level stipulated can be solved by using **query**

### glossary
- game
  - solution: a completed board generated by my own algo
  - puzzle: a solution with certain cells filled with 0
    - easy: 40 0-value cells
    - medium: 50 0-value cells
    - hard: 60 0-value cells
- ac
  - active cell
  - highest highlight priority
- auto-filled cells
  - cells filled by computer to generate a puzzle
  - color: black
- user-filled cells
  - cells filled by user to solve a puzzel
  - color: deep blue
- hl
  - highlights
  - types & priority:
    1. success: darkgray // ‚õîÔ∏è
    2. ac: skyblue
    3. conflict: pink
    4. same number: darkgray
    5. sudoku: lightgray
  - implementation:
    - ? do I need to use state
      - it seems that to change css you should only

## üå∏ Refactor highlight and input number features

highlight

- [x] breakdown hl sudoku, same num and AC
- [x] use a new state to save sudoku so it can be used in multiple opeartions

input number

- [x] change order of logic to: upon **onClick** of numpad is triggered, immediately change **bd**, then useEffect trigger a change in **ac**
- [ ] add conflict: string[] property to CellType. This property helps to realise the highlightConflict feature
- [ ]
